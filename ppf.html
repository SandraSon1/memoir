        <p>The air is humid and sticky. Wax slowly slides down the sides of the candles. The flames barely flicker. Children are playing outside. The sounds of laughter and hand games bellows into the room slowly getting drowned out by monks chanting. I follow along. My legs cross in a specific arrangement on the cool concrete ground giving relief to this hot day. My hands are softly placed together, palm to palm in Anjali Mudra. Earthy, aromatics fill the room as each person takes their turn. I watch as they burn their incense sticks and pray. I wonder what others pray for. Life is simple here. Around the room, are family and friends. We work, cook, eat and learn from one another. This village all belong to the same religion, Buddhism. </p>

         <p>We have the same common understanding, shared values, community and common good (Walker, Cassidy, Evans, Holroyd, & Jung, 2018).  We’ve only ever known of this. To me, my religion defines who I am. It allows me to practice and learn my values. My friend glances over, it’s my turn to pray. I quietly shuffle up and grab two sticks. I place the ends into the flame, they instantly ignite. They’re between my palms now. I’m facing towards the shrine. There are a vast of Butsuzos, that take the form of different materials and images. </p>

          <p>I’ve seen how some are made. I wear a small one around my neck, it’s fasten by string. A lot of practice and high level of handcraft is required when making them. When I was a lot younger my father took me to the local artisan to have one made. I still distinctively remember how meticulous and methodical he was. His workshop was at the back of his house, it viewed the village stream. It was open and had corrugated iron sheets balanced in place as roofing. The artisan would only craft for people he knew. He would work long hours completing it, then could go days or months without making anything. He was a family friend, this was a gift from him. He locally sourced all his materials, handpicking and inspecting each rock. He was a perfectionist and took pride in all his craft. My Dad and I watched him, it was really just mesmerising. The tools were laid out in a specific order, neatly aligned on his concrete workbench. Firstly, he marked out the basic shape. He then begins to chisel and sand as he goes. He uses a needle like tool to do the finer details. After a few days we went back to his shop my Dad passed him a strand of string that has been blessed by the monks. He fastens the buddha to the string and tied it around my neck. My Dad told me the meaning of it. It protects me from any evils and gives me good fortune and luck. I cherish it to this day. It’s a part of me now, it reminds me of my culture and values. One day I will pass it on to my daughter.  </p>

          <p>I’m walking through the bustling streets of the city. I swerve through frantic people. It’s a murky day, the evolving high-rise buildings block out any glimpse of the sun. All I can hear are different modes of transport, footsteps, cars, trains and buses. I reach for my phone to check the time. My bracelet gets caught in the belt loop of my pants. The string is intertwined in. As I untie my bracelet the buddha piece falls off. I quickly pick it up and reattach it. This bracelet means a lot to me. It has been passed down through generations of my family. The buddha piece is made from white jade. Cotton string is tied and looped to create the band. My Mum gave this to me, I can tell how important it is to her. It’s a memory of my Mum. Every time I look at it, it gives me a sense of comfort and safety. This is how I feel when I’m around her. She told me how this bracelet will protect me from all evils and bring me good fortune and luck. I wouldn’t say I’m a sceptic or that I don’t believe in Buddhism. I am open to the idea, just yet waiting for a reason to fully believe in it. I know it has a strong cultural value to her but growing up in a western society can conflict your values and ideologies from being nurtured in one while at the same time being exposed to another way of life. On my commute to work, shops don’t faze me. Today though, this shop catches my eye. I must walk past it most days, even twice a day.  </p>

        <p>On the window front is a wide range of buddha statues. They are in forms of different images and materials. This made me think of today’s western society. We are consumption based. We mass produce so that there is no value left in products and to the point that it is damaging the environment. They are now clones of one another. Traditions stand out in this society, modernity has shown a decline in shared values and thoughts. It has become irrelevant in our fast- paced, technology orientated world (Walker et al., 2018). A part of me is influenced by this culture. I don’t associate the cultural values as strongly as previous owners would have. I acknowledge and respect it, but it has a different significance to me. My bracelet is unique. It has imperfections and is made from a high-quality material, this makes it more valuable to others. To me the value lies in the associations it has.  </p>

          <p>It’s hot today- it’s always hot. They talk about a time where temperatures would go under 30 degrees. How did they survive those temperatures? The exhibition is uncanny. Photos and artefacts have resurfaced and are on display in this gallery. The exhibition is called The Anthropocene, it has attracted many people as it gives us a look into what earth use to look like. There are photos of forests- they were a large area that is completely covered in trees. Trees were the main source of oxygen in that time. During that epoch humans would strip the earth from its natural resources. It got to a point where they exhausted the earth from the high demand of resources that was needed to be extracted. </p>

        <p>Everything that was once made from mother earth is now artificially made. I’ve always known it to be this way. There are images of different modes of transportation. There are so many cars, there must have been at least one for each person. The caption states that transportation collectively emitted a high amount of greenhouse gases, polluting the air. I envy what humans seem to have back then. They had freedom to go outside and not worry about polluted air. They were able to swim in the seas and rivers. They had beautiful landscapes that was in the background of anywhere they looked. The only reminiscence we have of that period is the technofossils. They are a sea that surrounds this city. I’ve never seen it up close, we are banned from it as there are hazardous waste from that period such as electronics. </p>

        <br><br>

          <p>The main attraction is an artefact. It is about 4cms in length. It is small, but it’s made out of white Jade. White Jade is a natural rock formed by the earth. </p>

               <p>This is highly valued because it is the last piece of a naturally formed material. It’s quite detailed for how small it is. The description reads that it wasn't created by a machine, but by human hand. I was in such awe. How was someone able to get all those details in? There is no further information on what it is. I wonder what purpose this had. I wonder who that is. I catch myself just gazing at it. It gives of a sense of importance. I know this meant a great deal to someone at a different point of time. <br><br><br><br><br>
